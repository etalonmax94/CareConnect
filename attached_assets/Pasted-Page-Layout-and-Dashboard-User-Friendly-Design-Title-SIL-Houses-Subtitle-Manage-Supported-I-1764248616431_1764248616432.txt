Page Layout and Dashboard (User-Friendly Design):

Title: 'SIL Houses'
Subtitle: 'Manage Supported Independent Living accommodation and residents – NDIS Compliant'
Dashboard stats section (in easy-to-read cards with icons):
Total Houses: Count of all houses, subtext 'X active'
Total Residents: Current residents across houses, subtext 'of Y capacity'
Occupancy Rate: (Total residents / total capacity) * 100 as 'Z.Z%', subtext 'W beds available'
Property Types: Count of unique types
Add a compliance overview card: 'Compliance Status' showing '% houses with valid certificates' (calculate based on non-expired safety/fire/building dates)

Filters: Simple dropdowns for Status (All, Active, Inactive, Under Maintenance), Type (All, Apartment, House, Unit, Villa, Other), and a quick search bar for house name/address. Include a 'Filter' button to apply.
Main view: Responsive table/grid with columns: House Name, Full Address, Status, Type, Max Residents, Current Residents, Occupancy %, Compliance Status (e.g., 'Up to Date' if all dates valid, 'Action Needed' if expired), Actions (Edit, Delete, View Details).
If no houses: Centered message 'No houses yet. Get started by adding your first SIL house' with large 'Add First House' button.
Add House button always visible at top-right.

Tooltips: Hover tips on stats (e.g., 'Occupancy Rate: Based on current residents vs. max capacity per NDIS guidelines') and columns (e.g., 'Compliance Status: Ensures NDIS safety standards').
Workflow aids: Quick-action buttons like 'Export Report' for CSV/PDF of all houses (include all fields for NDIS audits).

Add/Edit House Form (Guided Workflow and NDIS Compliance):

Open as a multi-step wizard (steps: Basic Info > Details > Financial > Compliance > Review & Submit) to guide staff sequentially, reducing errors. Use progress bar at top.
Mandatory fields (*) with real-time validation (e.g., red highlights, error messages like 'Required for NDIS compliance').
Include NDIS-specific notes/tooltips (e.g., 'This field ensures alignment with NDIS Practice Standards for safe accommodation').

Navigation: Cancel, Previous, Next buttons. On submit: Log action in audit trail (e.g., 'House added by [user] on [date]'), refresh dashboard.
For edits: Pre-fill data, highlight changes for review.

Data Model and Backend Logic (Compliance-Focused):

House schema: All fields above, plus ID, created/updated timestamps, last_modified_by (for audits), current_residents (default 0).
Residents: Include a simple current_residents counter; add note for future integration with resident module to auto-update (e.g., link via house ID).
Stats: Real-time queries; add compliance % calculation (houses with all compliance dates valid / total houses).
CRUD with Compliance:
Create/Update: Require mandatory fields; log changes (store in separate audit table: action, user, timestamp, details).
Read: Secure access (assume role-based if CRM has users; e.g., staff view only).
Delete: Require confirmation with reason (logged for NDIS audits).

Filters/Search/Sort: Easy column sorting; search across name/address/type.
Error Handling: User-friendly messages (e.g., 'Safety Expiry must be future date for NDIS compliance').
Security/Compliance: Encrypt sensitive fields if possible; remind in UI: 'All data handled per NDIS privacy requirements'.
Exports: CSV/PDF with all data, including audit logs, for NDIS reporting.

Additional Features for Staff Workflow and NDIS:

Reminders: Alert badges on expired compliance dates (e.g., red icon if safety expiry < 30 days).
Integration: If CRM has residents/staff, link for auto-population.
Accessibility: Ensure UI is WCAG-compliant (e.g., alt text, keyboard nav) for NDIS inclusivity.
Testing: Add sample data; ensure end-to-end functionality with compliance checks.

This design simplifies workflows for staff while embedding NDIS compliance to minimize risks."
